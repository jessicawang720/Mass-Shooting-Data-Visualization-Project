					&emsp;&emsp;In our mass shooting dataset, mass shooting is increased dramatically after 2015. It hard for us to analysis the exact reason for the mass shooting because we only have a couple of years’ data. In addition, some of the data is hard to find and track. For example, the number of internet users and drug arrest data, we only have the years after 2000. Since there has lots of data are missing and most of cases were happened after 2000. I’m thinking to divided the dataset by two parts or I will just be focusing on the data after 2000 because the data for internet users or drug arrests I can’t find the data over 20 years. This quality of this dataset also needs to updates too. In the original dataset, over the half of the data in mental health are unclear.

					&emsp;&emsp;There also need to put the reason why the mass killers did that so that we can focus on specific areas to prevent these mass shooting. It is challenging for Mass shootings in the United States because it seems to have different views. Some of the young people think having a gun will solve their problem. In this dataset, there have young individuals that are enlightened or inspired to copy off of another mass killer. It is hard to track the data for these copycat crimes. In addition, gun control always is a big problem in the United States. Some areas may have problems with security in making it easy for anyone with a concealed weapon to enter in. It brings another question for the argument: is it too easy for American to get a gun? Excepts these, there are still lots of reasons might cause the mass shooting such as mental health and the media contagion effect. It is the reality that younger audiences are being exposed to. In the meantime, I need to focus on teaching people how to stay safe and how to get help for the mental disease which might help to prevent other mass shootings.
